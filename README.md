# Workforce Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attendance patterns at AtliQ Hardwares to identify trends affecting productivity. Using Power BI, we developed a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into work preferences, absenteeism, and seasonal illness impacts.

## Data Overview
The dataset consists of three months of employee attendance records, including:
- Employee details (ID, name)
- Attendance status (present, WFH, sick leave)
- Monthly statistics on leave and workdays

## Key Features
- **Data Transformation**: Merged and cleaned attendance records using Power BI techniques like unpivoting and column normalization.
- **Measures Implemented**: Calculated total working days, present percentages, WFH trends, and sick leave statistics.
- **Insights Generated**: Identified work preferences, absenteeism trends, and seasonal illness correlations.

## Results
The dashboard enables HR teams to make data-driven decisions, improving workforce management and overall productivity.
